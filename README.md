# **Oscar Zhang \- Personal Portfolio Website**

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience. The site serves as a central hub for my work as a Computer Science student at UC Berkeley.  
**Live Site:** [**oscarzhang.vercel.app**](https://oscarzhang.vercel.app/)

## **About This Project**

This portfolio was built from scratch to create a clean, modern, and fully responsive online presence. It highlights my journey in tech, featuring a collection of my work in full-stack development, machine learning, and data engineering. The goal was to build a fast, dynamic, and visually appealing site that effectively communicates my capabilities to potential employers and collaborators.

## **Technologies Used**

This project was built with a modern frontend stack, leveraging the following technologies:

* [**React**](https://react.dev/): A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.  
* [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/): A next-generation frontend build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience.  
* [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom, responsive designs without leaving the HTML.  
* [**JavaScript (ES6+)**](https://www.javascript.com/): The core programming language for the site's functionality.  
* [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/): The platform used for continuous integration and deployment, enabling seamless updates from the GitHub repository.

## **Features**

* **Responsive Design**: The UI is fully responsive and optimized for a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS's utility classes.  
* **Dynamic UI**: Built with React components for a modular and maintainable codebase.  
* **Project Showcase**: A dedicated section to display my key projects with descriptions, tech stacks, and links to live demos or source code.
